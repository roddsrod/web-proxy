# web-proxy
Script to quickly install web-proxy with self-signed certificate to bypass most blockages.
I'm just a hobbyist that took stuff already made from left and right and compiled it to suit my needs, 
if it helps anyone else then better :)
This script will install php-proxy and Glype running through Nginx on a Debian like distro fresh install.
It will install self signed certificate with default values.
This script was made to quickly create a functioning SSL web proxy, security has not been ehanced, 
SSL is just there to avoid proxy servers like Barracuda or Squid to read data and understand that we are trying to run a web proxy.
I obviously don't take any responsability on how this script could be used.
